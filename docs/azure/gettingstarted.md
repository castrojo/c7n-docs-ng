Getting Started {#azure_gettingstarted}
===============

Write your first policy {#azure_write-policy}
-----------------------

Cloud Custodian is a stateless rules engine that filters Azure resources
and takes actions on based on policies that you define.

Cloud Custodian policies are expressed in YAML and include the
following:

-   The type of resource to run the policy against
-   Filters to narrow down the set of resources
-   Actions to take on the filtered set of resources

Our first policy filters to a VM of a specific name, then adds the tag
`Hello: World`.

Create a file named `custodian.yml` with the following content. Update
`my_vm_name` to match an existing VM.

*Note: Some text editors (VSCode) inject invalid whitespace characters
when copy/pasting YAML from a browser*

``` {.yaml}
policies:
    - name: my-first-policy
      description: |
        Adds a tag to a virtual machines
      resource: azure.vm
      filters:
        - type: value
          key: name
          value: my_vm_name
      actions:
       - type: tag
         tag: Hello
         value: World
```

Run your policy {#azure_run-policy}
---------------

**Choose one of the supported authentication mechanisms**, and either
log in to Azure CLI or set environment variables as documented in
`azure_authentication`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

``` {.bash}
custodian run --output-dir=. custodian.yml
```

If successful, you should see output like the following on the command
line:

    2016-12-20 08:35:06,133: custodian.policy:INFO Running policy my-first-policy resource: azure.vm
    2016-12-20 08:35:07,514: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy resource:azure.vm has count:1 time:1.38
    2016-12-20 08:35:08,188: custodian.policy:INFO policy: my-first-policy action: tag: 1 execution_time: 0.67

You should also find a new `my-first-policy` directory with a log and a
`resources.json` file.

See `filters`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more information on the
features of the Value filter used in this sample.

### (Optional) Run your policy with Azure Monitoring {#monitor-azure-cc}

Cloud Custodian policies can emit logs and metrics to Application
Insights when the policy executes. Please refer to the
`azure_monitoring`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section for further
details.

View policy results {#azure_view_policy_reults}
-------------------

The `resources.json` file shows you the raw data that results from your
policy after filtering. This file can help you understand the fields
available for your resources while developing your policy.

### Custodian Report

Custodian has a report feature that allows the `resources.json` file to
be viewed more concisely. By default, this will output data in a CSV
format, but report also provides other output formats such as `grid`
that are more digestable.

When run, the result will look like this:

    +------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+
    | name       | location   | resourceGroup   | properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize   |
    +============+============+=================+=====================================+
    | my_vm_name | westus     | my_vm_rg        | Standard_D2_v2                      |
    +------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+

The fields produced by `custodian report` vary by resource (i.e.
properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize); however, you can add additional
fields to your report by using the `--field` parameter. For example, if
you want to see a list of tags on this resource:

``` {.bash}
custodian report --output-dir=. --format grid --field tags=tags custodian.yml
```

Result:

    +------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------+
    | name       | location   | resourceGroup   | properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize   | tagHeader                  |
    +============+============+=================+=====================================+============================+
    | my_vm_name | westus     | my_vm_rg        | Standard_D2_v2                      | {'custodian-tagged': True} |
    +------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------+

The `field` parameter has the format `--field header=field` where header
is the name of the column header in the report, and field is the
JMESPath of a specific field to include in the output. All available
fields for a resource can be found in the `resources.json` file.
