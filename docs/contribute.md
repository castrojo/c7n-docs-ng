If you\'re interested in contributing to Cloud Custodian development,

[Gitter](https://gitter.im/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian) and a

Code of Conduct
---------------

This project adheres to the \[CNCF Code of
Conduct\](<https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md>)

By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

Contributor agreement
---------------------

As a CNCF Project, we\'ve chosen to use the foundation\'s Contributor
License Agreements <https://github.com/cncf/cla>

to ensure that contributions are authorized and in good faith. We do
this in preference to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a
large portion of our contributor community don\'t have familiarity with
it.

The contributor agreement signing process is managed through the use of
the Linux Foundation\'s EasyCLA opensource project and is automatically
verified on any pull requests.
