Cloud Custodian Documentation
=============================

Cloud Custodian is a tool that unifies the dozens of tools and scripts
most organizations use for managing their public cloud accounts into one
open source tool. It uses a stateless rules engine for policy definition
and enforcement, with metrics, structured outputs and detailed reporting
for clouds infrastructure. It integrates tightly with serverless
runtimes to provide real time remediation/response with low operational
overhead.

Organizations can use Custodian to manage their cloud environments by
ensuring compliance to security policies, tag policies, garbage
collection of unused resources, and cost management from a single tool.

Cloud Custodian can be bound to serverless event streams across multiple
cloud providers that maps to security, operations, and governance use
cases. Custodian adheres to a compliance as code principle, so you can
validate, dry-run, and review changes to your policies.

Cloud Custodian policies are expressed in YAML and include the
following:

-   The type of resource to run the policy against
-   Filters to narrow down the set of resources
-   Actions to take on the filtered set of resources
